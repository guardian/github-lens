## Repo Rules

This table is autogenerated from the Rules object as a human-readable reference to our GitHub best practices.

| Rule | Description |
|---|---|
| hasOwner | Repositories are required to have a team owner for smoother handover in case someone leaves or moves to another team. When somebody leaves the org, any individual access they had to a repository is maintained, so there is a security case for this rule as well as a maintainability one. |
| hasValidTopic | Currently, we mandate that production P+E repos need to be reliably integrated with Snyk. In order to work out which projects contain production code, we ask that all choose from a list of status tags |
| defaultBranchIsMain | Github's default for the head branch is now main. Many workflow tools rely on this assumption, and it is considered to be a more inclusive choice of language. |
