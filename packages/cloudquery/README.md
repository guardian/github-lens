# CloudQuery
This directory includes details of our installation of [CloudQuery](https://www.cloudquery.io/).

Each directory's README has complete detail, but at a high level, we have:
- [DEV](DEV) holding the configuration for running CloudQuery locally
- [PROD](PROD) holding the configuration for running CloudQuery in production
- [SQL](sql) holding SQL queries[^1]

[^1]: These are not yet automatically applied. We should consider using [flyway](https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd/migrate-184127460.html), [prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), or similar.
