## RepoCop/Vulnerability API - Extension 01
Following the adoption of [CloudQuery](https://www.cloudquery.io/) as the mechanism to collect data, we have removed the following services:
- GitHub data fetcher
- GitHub lens API
- Services API

This has allowed us to reduce complexity by not having to maintain the code for these services. 

RepoCop was using GitHub lens API as a data source. As the lens API no longer exists, we have also removed RepoCop.

RepoCop as a service is still a valuable idea, and we should consider re-introducing it in the future.
